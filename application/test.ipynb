The first Indo-German agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras was signed in 1959.\\n\\nThe Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs. The IIT system has twenty three Institutes of Technology. The first of these to be instituted are at Kharagpur (estb. 1951), Mumbai (estb. 1958), Chennai (estb. 1959), Kanpur (estb. 1959), Delhi (estb. 1961), Guwahati (estb. 1994) and Roorkee (estb. 1847, joined IITs in 2001).\\n\\nThe Institute has sixteen academic departments and several advanced research centres in various disciplines of engineering and pure sciences. A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student community, excellent technical & supporting staff and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of IIT Madras. The campus is located in the city of Chennai, previously known as Madras. Chennai is the state capital of Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India.\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\n\\r\\n                Indian Institute of Technology Madras \\n\\nIIT P.O., Chennai 600 036\\n\\nINDIA\\n\\nView Site Map\\n\\nView Site Map\\n\\nAbout IITM\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\r\\n              |\\n\\nTerms of Service\\r\\n              |\\n\\nAccessibility', metadata={'source': '/Users/hritik/Desktop/Grading Doc RAG/Document/www/aboutIITM.html'}),\n",

The first Indo-German agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the establishment of the Indian\\r\\n        Institute of Technology at Madras was signed in 1959.\\n\\nThe Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research\\r\\n        and Cultural Affairs. The IIT system has twenty three Institutes of Technology. The first of these to be\\r\\n        instituted are at Kharagpur (estb. 1951), Mumbai (estb. 1958), Chennai (estb. 1959), Kanpur (estb. 1959), Delhi\\r\\n        (estb. 1961), Guwahati (estb. 1994) and Roorkee (estb. 1847, joined IITs in 2001).\\n\\nThe Institute has sixteen academic departments and several advanced research centres in various disciplines of\\r\\n        engineering and pure sciences. A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student community, excellent\\r\\n        technical & supporting staff and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of\\r\\n        IIT Madras. The campus is located in the city of Chennai, previously known as Madras. Chennai is the state\\r\\n        capital of Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India.\\n\\nIITM’s Experience in Online Education\\n\\nIITM is well-equipped to provide an online degree course. We have been ranked number 1 Engineering Institute for\\r\\n        the past 5 years and we have been ranked number 1 Overall for the past 2 years by NIRF.\\n\\nFurthermore, IITM began the NPTEL program, the country’s first online content portal as an inter-IIT consortium\\r\\n        project in 2001 and\\r\\n        nptel.ac.in is one of the largest online course portals in\\r\\n        the world. In 2014, IITM also created NPTEL online courses - the country’s first Massive Open Online Course\\r\\n        (MOOC). Today, NPTEL is considered the largest MOOC provider in India.\\n\\nMHRD launched the SWAYAM MOOC platform in 2017 and NPTEL has been the largest contributor to it. NPTEL also\\r\\n        manages the national MOOCs portal -\\r\\n        swayam.gov.in\\r\\n        as well as the network of more than 3800 SWAYAM local chapter colleges. With IITM continuing to lead the NPTEL\\r\\n        project, it makes them the perfect choice to offer an online degree program.\\n\\nWhy an Online Degree Initiative?\\n\\nIIT Madras wishes to reach out to the many aspiring and motivated learners across India. An online degree is the\\r\\n        perfect way to accomplish this, as it is not limited by on-campus physical infrastructure.\\n\\nBeing an online program, we can accommodate between 50,000 to a lakh learners per batch.\\n\\nIt is a game changer as\\r\\n          working professionals, and learners of any age group\\r\\n          can enroll in it.\\n\\nStudents currently enrolled in a physical college in any program can join here and\\r\\n           earn their second degree. (University Grants Commission had\\r\\n          announced in 2020 that students will now be permitted to pursue two degree programs simultaneously if one is\\r\\n          in online mode)\\n\\nSince there are\\r\\n          no restrictions on the base subjects, students from other streams such as commerce / arts / law\\r\\n          and of course, science students can enroll in this program. Data Science and Machine Learning is proving to be\\r\\n          useful in all disciplines and fields.\\n\\nAll courses will be offered 3 times a year. Thus, learners have\\r\\n           considerable flexibility in the pace they can select\\r\\n          to move ahead in the program.\\n\\nThe program gives\\r\\n          flexibility to learners to set their goals. Learners who\\r\\n          successfully complete all 8 courses in Foundational Level can get a certificate and exit. Alternatively, they\\r\\n          can proceed to do the more specialised courses in the Diploma Level and exit with a Diploma in Programming\\r\\n          AND/OR Diploma in Data Science from IIT Madras. However, those interested in acquiring the BS degree can\\r\\n          proceed to take up the Degree Level courses. Check the\\r\\n          Academics\\r\\n          page for details. Based on their requirements, they can acquire certifications that will help them with better\\r\\n          employment opportunities.\\n\\nThe program will be rigorous in its delivery, just as any other\\r\\n          program from IIT Madras. Learners have to spend time with the coursework every week and achieve minimum\\r\\n          criteria to pass every course.\\n\\nBeing an online program, the\\r\\n          course content can be accessed by learners from anywhere. They\\r\\n          need to have a laptop / desktop, a good internet connection, and more importantly, the will to learn and work\\r\\n          hard. Learners will be required to travel to designated exam centres only for the quizzes and exams each term.\\r\\n          View section about\\r\\n          exam cities.\\n\\nEach course will have a\\r\\n          discussion forum with an active academic team to help\\r\\n          in clearing doubts. We plan to bring in more personalised mentors to help students with Diploma Level and\\r\\n          Degree Level courses.\\n\\nIn future, we are considering\\r\\n          tie-ups with industries to enable internships and project opportunities. This will also facilitate hiring of our learners who perform well in the program.\\n\\nRelevant Links\\n\\nwww.iitm.ac.in\\n\\n/ReachIITM\\n\\n/ReachIITM\\n\\n/iitmadras\\n\\nFaculty Co-ordinators\\n\\nBS Data Science and Applications\\n\\nDr. Andrew Thangaraj\\n\\nAndrew Thangaraj, Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology\\r\\n          Madras, has been with the institute since June 2004.

Starting with blind search we quickly move on to heuristic search, and look at several variations designed to combat the combinatorial explosion that search has to face. We study how board games like Chess and Go are played; how search facilitates logical reasoning; and approaches to domain independent planning of actions to achieve a goal. We end with looking at an alternative formulation that combines search and reasoning as constraint processing.\\n\\nby\\r\\n                \\r\\n                Deepak Khemani\\n\\nCourse ID: BSCS3003\\n\\nCourse Credits: 4\\n\\nCourse Type: Core Option II\\n\\nPre-requisites:\\r\\n                            \\r\\n                                None\\n\\nWhat you’ll learnVIEW COURSE VIDEOS\\n\\nGet a historical and philosophical perspective on artificial intelligence.\\n\\nThe ability to formulate problems in a general problem solving framework.\\n\\nKnowledge of domain independent search based problem solving algorithms.\\n\\nKnowledge of stochastic, local, and population based search algorithms.\\n\\nThe foundations of problem decomposition and rule based methods.\\n\\nAbility to implement game playing algorithms.\\n\\nAn understanding of the relation between search methods and other with other\\r\\nformulations including planning, constraints and logical reasoning.\\n\\nCourse structure & Assessments\\n\\n12 weeks of coursework, weekly online assignments, 2 in-person invigilated quizzes, 1 in-person invigilated end term exam.\\r\\n                For details of standard course structure and assessments, visit\\r\\n                Academics\\r\\n                page.\\n\\nWEEK 1 Introduction and philosophy.

He graduated with three degrees from IIT Bombay, including two in Computer Science. His areas of research are broadly in Artificial Intelligence.He is the author of a text book ‘A First Course in Artificial Intelligence’. He has three online courses on Swayam developed as part of the NPTEL program, covering problem-solving using search, knowledge representation and reasoning, and constraint satisfaction.\\n\\n\\r\\n                                ...\\xa0\\r\\n                                \\n\\nmore\\n\\nHis research focus is in the areas of knowledge, memory, reasoning and planning. He plans to employ these to build articulate systems that can take a problem-solving approach to teaching by a machine, especially in the areas of high school mathematics and science. More recently he has worked in the domain of multi-agent systems where an agent has to reason with what other agents know and believe. He is working towards implementing a contract bridge playing program that reasons like a human expert.The human-level contract bridge playing agent will be required to do epistemic planning while collaborating with a team member and competing against opponents in an environment of incomplete information.\\n\\nless\\n\\nVisit website\\n\\nView all Degree Level courses\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\nsupport@study.iitm.ac.in\\n\\n7850999966\\n\\n\\r\\n              IITM BS Degree Office, 3rd Floor, ICSR Building,\\n\\nIIT Madras, Chennai - 600036\\n\\nPlease use ONLY the above methods for any queries regarding the program.\\r\\n                  Our normal response time is 3 working days.

The first Indo-German agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the\\r\\n            establishment of the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras was\\r\\n            signed in 1959.\\n\\nThe Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Prof. Humayun\\r\\n            Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs.\\r\\n            The IIT system has twenty three Institutes of Technology. The first\\r\\n            of these to be instituted are at Kharagpur (estb. 1951), Mumbai\\r\\n            (estb. 1958), Chennai (estb. 1959), Kanpur (estb. 1959), Delhi\\r\\n            (estb. 1961), Guwahati (estb. 1994) and Roorkee (estb. 1847, joined\\r\\n            IITs in 2001).\\n\\nThe Institute has sixteen academic departments and several advanced\\r\\n            research centres in various disciplines of engineering and pure\\r\\n            sciences. A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student\\r\\n            community, excellent technical & supporting staff and an effective\\r\\n            administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of IIT\\r\\n            Madras. The campus is located in the city of Chennai, previously\\r\\n            known as Madras. Chennai is the state capital of Tamil Nadu, a\\r\\n            southern state in India.\\n\\nIITM’s Experience in Online Education\\n\\nIITM is well-equipped to provide an online diploma program. We have\\r\\n            been ranked number 1 Engineering Institute for the past 5 years and\\r\\n            we have been ranked number 1 Overall for the past 2 years by NIRF.\\n\\nFurthermore, IITM began the NPTEL program, the country’s first\\r\\n            online content portal as an inter-IIT consortium project in 2001 and\\r\\n            nptel.ac.in is\\r\\n            one of the largest online course portals in the world. In 2014, IITM\\r\\n            also created NPTEL online courses - the country’s first Massive Open\\r\\n            Online Course (MOOC). Today, NPTEL is considered the largest MOOC\\r\\n            provider in India.\\n\\nMHRD launched the SWAYAM MOOC platform in 2017 and NPTEL has been\\r\\n            the largest contributor to it. NPTEL also manages the national MOOCs\\r\\n            portal -\\r\\n            swayam.gov.in\\r\\n            as well as the network of more than 3800 SWAYAM local chapter\\r\\n            colleges. With IITM continuing to lead the NPTEL project, it makes\\r\\n            them the perfect choice to offer an online diploma program.\\n\\nRelevant Links\\n\\nwww.iitm.ac.in\\n\\n/ReachIITM\\n\\n/ReachIITM\\n\\n/iitmadras\\n\\nContact Us\\n\\n\\r\\n                IITM BS Degree Office,\\n\\n3rd Floor, ICSR\\r\\n                Building,\\n\\nIIT Madras, Chennai - 600036\\n\\nFor any queries, please reach out to us through one of the following modes:\\r\\n\\r\\n                Please email support-diploma@study.iitm.ac.in - Our normal response time is 3 working days.

Hence, the task of making good decisions is not easy. The answer is in building quantitative models, and this course is designed to help you understand the fundamentals of this critical, foundational, business skill. The business application of statistical methods is the core focus of this course. In that sense, the course builds on the core course in the first year of the program. That basic course focused on the preliminaries of the area.

However, this degree program (while maintaining the standard of IIT)\\r\\n                                        has given us a chance to grow and improve in our lives.\\n\\nAlso, I have personally checked many online programs by many Institutes and Universities - however, none of them is so inspiring, innovative and challenging (at\\r\\n                                        the same time).\\n\\nIt's such a great initiative of IIT Madras. I can't thank you enough and all the people who are involved in making it happen. I want to specially thanks Prof.\\r\\n                                        Andrew and Prof. Pratap for clarifying all our doubts and also the professors and course support team - without which I could have never qualified this process.\\n\\nYash Raj Karthikey\\n\\nfrom Bengaluru, Karnataka, India\\n\\nMy name is Akriti Vishwas, I come from Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nI came across this online degree program on the internet. I just completed my 12th standard and was enrolled in a bachelor degree in Hansraj College of Delhi\\r\\n                                        University pursuing physics honours. Apart from my degree I wanted to explore something new. This program from such an esteemed institution like IIT MADRAS\\r\\n                                        seemed exciting to me. The unique program captured my attention and I enrolled for the qualifier level. The ever increasing career opportunities in data science\\r\\n                                        also contributed in a positive way. After taking the classes from such qualified faculty, my interest in the program grew. The unique pedagogy used by the\\r\\n                                        teachers is what I found most engaging. The dedicated support team also helped many learners like me at all times if we faced any difficulties. Now, after\\r\\n                                        qualifying the first level and being a student of the foundational level, I am looking forward to this course and learning in a unique and first of its kind\\r\\n                                        way.\\n\\nAkriti Vishwas\\n\\nfrom Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh, India\\n\\nThis is Satej.\\n\\nI want to just like appreciate the IIT team. They are doing a fabulous job. Even though we haven't met, it doesn't like that due to amazing interaction and\\r\\n                                        course planning of BSc course of IIT Madras. They are managing at such a level without disturbing the standard of IIT.

The first Indo-German agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the establishment of the Indian\\r\\n                            Institute of Technology at Madras was signed in 1959.\\n\\nThe Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research\\r\\n                            and Cultural Affairs. The IIT system has twenty three Institutes of Technology. The first of these to be\\r\\n                            instituted are at Kharagpur (estb. 1951), Mumbai (estb. 1958), Chennai (estb. 1959), Kanpur (estb. 1959), Delhi\\r\\n                            (estb. 1961), Guwahati (estb. 1994) and Roorkee (estb. 1847, joined IITs in 2001).\\n\\nThe Institute has sixteen academic departments and several advanced research centres in various disciplines of\\r\\n                            engineering and pure sciences. A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student community, excellent\\r\\n                            technical & supporting staff and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of\\r\\n                            IIT Madras. The campus is located in the city of Chennai, previously known as Madras. Chennai is the state\\r\\n                            capital of Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India.\\n\\nWe have been ranked number 1 Engineering Institute for the past 6 years and we have been ranked number 1 Overall\\r\\n                            for the past 2 years by NIRF.\\n\\nIITM’s Experience in Online Education\\n\\nIITM is well-equipped to provide online programs, which has been proven with its experience in the NPTEL and BS\\r\\n                            in Data Science programs.\\n\\nNational Program on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL)\\n\\nFurthermore, IITM began the NPTEL program, the country’s first online content portal as an inter-IIT consortium\\r\\n                            project in 2003 and\\r\\n                            nptel.ac.in\\r\\n                            is one of the largest online course repository in the world for engineering content. In 2014, NPTEL started\\r\\n                            offering courses for certification and currently more than 1300 courses are offered for certification per year,\\r\\n                            with more than 40 lakh enrollments and 8 lakh students registering for exams.\\n\\nNPTEL also manages the national MOOCs portal -\\r\\n                            swayam.gov.in\\r\\n                            as well as the network of more than 5300 SWAYAM local chapter colleges.\\n\\nIIT Madras’ BS in Data Science and Applications\\n\\nBased on the experience gained from NPTEL, IIT Madras launched the 4 year BS degree program in Data Science and\\r\\n                            Applications\\r\\n                            study.iitm.ac.in/ds.\\r\\n                            This program has a non-JEE qualifier based entry into the program and is open to learners from all streams and\\r\\n                            backgrounds, requiring nothing more than English and Maths at std X and completion of std XII. More than 16000\\r\\n                            students study in the program, which is now in its third year of offering.\\n\\nThe program can be paced by the learner who can select the number of courses they wish to register every term\\r\\n                            and there are multiple exits such as the Foundation level certificate, Diploma in programming, Diploma in data\\r\\n                            Science, BSc in programming and Data Science and finally the BS degree. Based on the number of credits accrued,\\r\\n                            the exits are available.\\n\\nStudents in the program also are provided with opportunities to interact by means of the groups and houses into\\r\\n                            which they are divided and actively participate in the techno-sports-cultural festival called Paradox that is\\r\\n                            held on IITM campus in the month of May.\\n\\nMany students are actively pursuing internships and some have even been recruited by companies already.

The course will begin with a tear down of a laptop and/ or a mobile phone and looking at the various components. The standout component on the board is the battery which naturally leads to an introduction to voltage and finite energy sources. The course will then go on to identify a couple of ICs on the board like the processor, the RF components all connected to the same power source, each drawing its own current which can be used to motivate the idea of KCL. Basic network analysis will be covered as part of the theory to go hand in hand with these topics. Simple experiments will be conducted on a breadboard to demonstrate the theory where applicable.

The course will begin with a tear down of a laptop and/ or a mobile phone and looking at the various components. The standout component on the board is the battery which naturally leads to an introduction to voltage and finite energy sources. The course will then go on to identify a couple of ICs on the board like the processor, the RF components all connected to the same power source, each drawing its own current which can be used to motivate the idea of KCL. Basic network analysis will be covered as part of the theory to go hand in hand with these topics. Simple experiments will be conducted on a breadboard to demonstrate the theory where applicable.
