          Our goal is to provide current and future visitors to the IIT Madras
          ONLINE DEGREE Site with the best possible educational experience. To
          further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different
          versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize
          the experience to the individual learner (to assess the learner’s
          level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited
          to the learner), to improve our understanding of the learning process,
          and to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of our course materials,
          payment models, platform features, and offerings. We may publish or
          otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise
          permitted under the Privacy Policy, those publications or public
          disclosures will not include your personal information.
