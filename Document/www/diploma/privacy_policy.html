                        IIT Madras stores information, including Personal Information, on its own servers and also on
                        servers
                        of companies that IIT Madras hires to provide services. In each case, information may be stored
                        in
                        India and in countries where IIT Madras’s service providers operate and the privacy laws of
                        India
                        shall
                        be applicable. <br /><br />IIT Madras controls its own copy of information collected through the
                        IIT
                        Madras
                        DIPLOMA PROGRAMMES site and may have an information security program designed to protect information
                        in
                        its
                        possession or control. This may be done through a variety of privacy and security policies,
                        processes,
                        and procedures. IIT Madras may use administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that
                        reasonably
                        and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information
                        that
                        it
                        collects, receives, stores, or transmits. Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the
                        Internet,
                        or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, IIT Madras cannot guarantee its
                        absolute
                        security. While IIT Madras will work hard to ensure the integrity and security of its network
                        and
                        systems,
                        IIT Madras cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent “hackers” or other
                        unauthorized
                        persons from illegally accessing or obtaining information. <br /><br />If IIT Madras learns of a
                        security
                        breach involving its copy of your Personal Information, IIT Madras may attempt to notify you
                        electronically
                        so that you may take appropriate protective steps. By using the IIT Madras DIPLOMA PROGRAMMES site or
                        providing
                        Personal Information to IIT Madras, you agree that IIT Madras can communicate with you
                        electronically
                        regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the IIT Madras
                        DIPLOMA PROGRAMMES site. If a security systems breach occurs, IIT Madras may post a notice on the IIT Madras
                        DIPLOMA PROGRAMMES site and may send an email to you at the email address associated with your IIT Madras
